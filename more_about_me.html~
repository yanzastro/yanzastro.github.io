<h1 style="color:#002859;"> More about Me</h1>

<h2 style="color:#002859;">How to pronounce my name?</h2>

<p style="color:#002859;">I was born in Xinhuang, a beautiful town in the west of Hunan Province, China. I've been interested in the surrounding world since childhood. My father is a geography teacher in high school who taught me much about the nature. He told me how stars move and why they glitter, why moon looks bright, which brought up my interest in the starring sky.</p>
<p style="color:#002859;" align="center"><img src="20110224142355150617.JPG" width="700" height="353" /></p>
<p style="color:#002859;" align="center">(A picture of my hometown. Image from: <a href="http://www.hnxhnews.com/Info.aspx?ModelId=1&amp;Id=8654" target="_blank">http://www.hnxhnews.com/Info.aspx?ModelId=1&amp;Id=8654</a>)</p>
<p style="color:#002859;">I first came into physics when I was in middle school. I found it excited to learn about how the nature operates. One of my classmates, Hui (now he is in USTC studying quantum information), recommended me to read Stephen Hawking's book, from which I saw how incredably interesting and magical physics is. He also owned a small telescope, by which I observed beautiful Saturn Ring, crator on the moon and sun spots. It was then that I made up my mind to study astrophysics in the future.</p>
<p style="color:#002859;">In the spring of 2008, I began watching starring sky to identify constellation. It was also great fun even I did not have a telescope and just watched by my naked eyes or binoculars. In the autumn, I went to Beijing to continue my study in <a href="http://www.mdfz.com.cn/" target="_blank">High School Affiliated to Minzu University</a>. I met students from all over China, which greatly broadened my sight.</p>
<p style="color:#002859;">I was admitted by Department of Physics, Tsinghua University in 2011. Thanks to THU-one of the best university in China, I got to know many outstanding professors and classmates, from whom I learnt a lot. After 4 years study, I not only gained much in physics knowledge but also found my true interest in cosmology. After I graduated from Tsinghua, I came to UBC to continue my study as a master student. UBC is overall a great place for astronomy. Everyone loves their work and we communicate a lot. My supervisor, professors and predessesors are quite helpful. I enjoy my work here very much.</p>

<h1 style="color:#002859;"> My Life outside Physics</h1>

<p style="color:#002859;">I love classical music. I listened to a lot of popular classical works (like <I>Fur Elise</I> by Beethoven) when I was in elementary school. My interest grew as I began to play the violin when I was 8. Though I haven't learned from a teacher since I was 15, I still keep practicing a lot and enjoying it. From 2015, I began to listen to classical music systematically. From a public course by Prof. Craig Wright from Yale (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_yOVARO2Oc&list=PLh9mgdi4rNezhx8YiGIV8I22ICSuzslja" target="_blanck">here</a>) I learned basic music theory and history of music. After having listen to loads of masterpieces, I feel Brahms touches me the most; Beethoven motivates me the most and Bach calms me down (actually these 3B's are my favorite composers). I also cannot resist music by Chopin, Tschaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Mahler and many others.</p>



<p style="color:#002859;"> My mom is a Chinese teacher and she brought up my interest in it. I learned to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_poetry#Tang_poetry" target="_blanck">Chinese traditional poetry</a> when I was undergrad and still writing now. Chinese poetry is the perfect combination of form and content beauty. The rules for writting poetries are very strict. Under these rules, the tones of Chinese characters naturally make a piece of 'melody'. Beautiful and concise rhetorics construct artistic conception which reflects the thought and feeling of the poet.</p>

<p style="color:#002859;">Chinese traditional poetry also brings up my interest to linguistics. It studies the rules of languages and how they evolves. There are about 6000 different kinds of languages in the world and each is a complete system. After reading some pedagogical books about language, I'm attracted by how people organize different sounds and communicate with them. It is surprising that many languages are from the same 'ancestor' (like English, German, French, Spain, etc are inherited from proto-Indo-European language) but evolve into very different systems. It is like the biological evolution, but it's totally artificial. I'm also interested in Entomology, a study of insects. I'm attacted by these colorful little creatures and amazed by their great vitality.</p>


<p style="color:#002859;">I have a broad range of interest. I love playing table tennis and I was a team member in department team of Tsinghua Physics. Now I'm a member in UBC table tennis club. In my daily life, I like watching Japanese anime and manga. My favorite anime director is Hayao Miyazaki, who is one of the best anime director nowadays. I am deeply impressed by the humanistic care he converts to us in his movies. I was greatly encouraged by manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Spoon_%28manga%29" target="_blank">Silver Spoon</a> by Hiromu Arakawa. I'm a big fan of <I>Harry Potter</I> and Cartoon <I>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</I>. I sometimes draw stick figures of anime characters, play rubric cube and Minecraft.</p>
