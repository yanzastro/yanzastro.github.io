               <h3>Overview</h3>
               <block>
                  <p>I'm interested in cross-analyzing data from different "tracers"(galaxy number density, shear, tSZ, X-ray, CIB, CMB lensing, etc) of the large-scale structure (LSS) to understand different 
                     physical processes happening on different scales. In addition, I'm developing tools and software for LSS analysis, including ``organized random'' to mitigate non-uniformity in two-point functions, an end-to-end measurement pipeline for KiDS 6x2-pt analysis, packaged for photometric realization and redshift calibration (with self-organizing maps) for weak lensing cosmology.
                  </p>

                     See my publication list in my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=knM-NWEAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" class="navh">Google Scholar Profile </a></br>

               <h3>Cross-correlating different LSS tracers</h3>
               <h4>Cosmic thermal history and baryonic feedback with KiDS-tSZ cross-correlations</h4>
               <block>
                  <p align="center"><img src="tomocross.png" width="80%" height="80%" /></p>
                  <p> I led the project to measure tomographic cross-correlations between KiDS galaxy maps and the Planck tSZ Compton-y map to study the thermal history of the Universe (see our <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2021/07/aa40568-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper</a> for more detail.)
                     I also contribute to studying the impact of the baryonic effect on cosmological constraints with cross-correlation between KiDS lensing and tSZ signals (see our <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2022/04/aa42197-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper</a> for more detail.).
                     and cosmic star formation history, interstellar dust and galaxy abundance with galaxy- cosmic infrared background cross-correlations (see the papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2204.01649</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10848" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2310.10848</a> for more detail.). These works show that tomographic cross-correlation between galaxy and LSS tracers can shed light on different galaxy-scale physics.

               </block>

               <h4>Cosmic star formation history, extragalactic dust properties, and galaxy abundance with galaxy-CIB cross-correlations</h4>
               <block>
                  <p> 
                  Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) encodes rich information about cosmic star formation history, extragalactic dust properties, and galaxy abundance. In this <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2022/09/aa43710-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work</a>, we measure the tomographic cross-correlation between KiDS galaxy maps and Planck CIB maps to constrain cosmic star formation history up to z~1.5. Our results agree with multiwavelength studies. 
                  We further study star formation history (see this  <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2024/05/058/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper</a>), dust thermodynamics and galaxy abundance with cross-correlation between unWISE galaxy maps and CIB. These studies provide complimentary analysis on galaxy-scale physics with large-scale statistics.

               <h3>Studies on galaxy clusters with hydrodynamical simulation and machine learning</h3>
               <h4>An estimation of galaxy cluster mass with deep learning</h4>
               <block>
                  <p align="center"><img src="cnn.png" width="80%" height="80%" /></p>
                  <p>We train a set of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to measure galaxy cluster mass from galaxy cluster stellar mass, X-ray luminosities, and Compton-y images from BAHAMAS simulation. 
                     We show that CNNs are capable of making precise mass predictions with mean mass biases of around 1% 
                     with scatters of around 17%, which is better than traditional methods. Our work shows the great potential of deep learning algorithms in studying galaxy 
                     clusters. We also explore the interpretability of our machine-learning method. (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11819v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this paper</a> for more detail.)

               <block>
                  <p align="center"><img src="offset.png" width="80%" height="80%" /></p>
                  <p>With simulated galaxy clusters from BAHAMAS simulation, we model the probability distribution function(PDF) of the cluster centroid offset. In this work, we fit the PDF of offsets of 7 observation-motivated galaxy cluster 
                     centroids. Our best-fit PDFs can be used to estimate cluster mass and cluster density profiles in real observations. We have also studied the mass dependence of mean offset and mass bias estimated from
                     off-centered cluster density profiles. (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06663v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this paper</a> for more detail.)

               </header>
               <p> In Chinese, 'the Universe' is called 'Yu Zhou (&#x5B87;&#x5B99;)'. As an ancient Chinese philosopher Shi Jiao (390 B.C-330 B.C) put it: 
                  "The space surrounding us is 
                  called 'Yu(&#x5B87;)'; the time from the past to the future is called 'Zhou(&#x5B99;)'.
                  (&#x4E0A;&#x4E0B;&#x56DB;&#x65B9;&#x66F0;&#x5B87;&#xFF0C;&#x5F80;&#x53E4;&#x6765;&#x4ECA;&#x66F0;&#x5B99;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x300A;&#x5C38;&#x5B50;&#x300B;)" 
                  This is a perfect definition of "the Universe": all of space and time. Cosmology studies the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the Universe. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  At the beginning of the 20th century, Einstein proposed General Relativity, the geometric theory of spacetime. 
                  In 1917, Einstein published &ldquo;<em>Cosmological Considerations in the General Theory of Relativity.</em>&rdquo; 
                  It is the first scientific paper to study the structure of our Universe. It started an era of physical cosmology. 
                  The fundamental theory on how the cosmos evolves was developed before the 1940's and explains the famous discovery by Edwin Hubble: the Universe is expanding. 
                  The theory is called the &quot; Big Bang Theory&quot;. It describes how the Universe expands from a very high-density and high-temperature state.
               </p>
               <p>In addition to the Hubble expansion, another evidence of the Big Bang Theory is the 'Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)', which is the afterglow of the 
                  Big Bang.
                  It is the earliest light that we can ever see. It contains a tremendous amount of information about the early Universe, 
                  as well as serving as the 'seed'
                  of the large-scale structure of the Universe.
               </p>
               <p align="center"><img src="images/research-1.jpg" width=100% height=100% /></p>

               <p>The Big Bang cosmology assumes that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic. However, observations show that the Universe is not that uniform.
                  Galaxies cluster together by gravity to make 'galaxy clusters'; galaxy clusters are connected with 'filaments'; some regions of space are 
                  left empty as 'voids':
                  they are called the 'large-scale structure' of the Universe. Studies on the large-scale structure grow up in the latter half
                  of the 20th century. Cosmological surveys provide a large amount of data, and we are learning about the formation and evolution of the large-scale 
                  structure from them.
               </p>
               <p> Observations show that the mass of our Universe is made up of ordinary matter by a fraction of less than 40%. The rest are 'dark matter' that does not emit
                  or scatter any light. Moreover, matter (ordinary matter and dark matter) only makes up about 30% of the total density of the Universe, while the rest is
                  mysterious 'dark energy'. The nature of these two dark sectors of our Universe is among the most fundamental questions in modern cosmology.
                  We are trying to answer these questions from the expansion history of the Universe and the evolution of large-scale structure.

               <p> Another exciting problem is the 'cosmological inflation', a dramatic acceleration phase of the early Universe 
                  (when the universe was 10<sup>-36</sup> seconds old). During inflation, the Universe expands by 10<sup>26</sup> in 10<sup>-32</sup> seconds.
                  Inflation was first proposed to solve some puzzles in the standard model of cosmology, but there is no direct evidence to prove its existence yet. Nor do
                  we understand how it happened.
               <p>In addition to what is said above, there are tons of questions in cosmology, which makes it a lively field of modern physics and astronomy. 
                  With the improvement of observations, it's hopeful that we will gain essential insight into our Universe in the near future.
